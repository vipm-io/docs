!!! info "🚀 New: VIPM 2026 Q1 Preview Available"

    We recommend trying the new **[VIPM 2026 Q1 Preview](../preview.md)** which includes the VIPM CLI plus native Linux installers in both RPM and DEB package formats. This provides a much better installation experience than the legacy VIPM 2022 release documented below.
