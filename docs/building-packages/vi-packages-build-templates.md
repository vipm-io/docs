#VI Package Build Templates
VI Package Build Templates are just `.vipb` files with a `.vipt` file extension that tells VI Package Builder that the file is a template.

When you open the template, VI Package Builder will ask you to set the Source Directory, Product Name and Company Name upon opening the .vipt file and then use those settings in the new .vipb.
