# VIPM CLI Command Reference (Work in Progress)

We are building a comprehensive command reference that covers syntax, options, expected output, exit codes, and common errors for every `vipm` command.

## Current Status

- See `dev-docs/cli-docs-improvement-proposal.md` for the latest plan and scope.
- Use built-in help in the meantime:
  - `vipm help` lists all available commands.
  - `vipm <command> --help` shows authoritative syntax and options for the specified command.

## Temporary Resources

- [Getting Started guide](getting-started.md) for the essential workflow.
- [Docker](docker.md) and [GitHub Actions](github-actions.md) pages for environment-specific examples.

_This page will be replaced with the full reference once Phase 2 work is complete._
