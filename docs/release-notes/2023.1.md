# VIPM 2023.1 for Windows - Release Notes

**Notice: This is a Release Candidate**

## What's New

- Added support for LabVIEW 2023 (not yet released by NI).
- VIPM for Windows is now a native 64-bit application (note: it still works with all your installed LabVIEW versions, both 32-bit and 64-bit).
- Significant performance increases for launch time, refreshing package list, installing packages, creating/applying VIPC's, etc.
- Easier search for packages on vipm.io (VIPM Browser and System Tray are no longer included)
- More package building, package configuration management, and other features are available to all LabVIEW users.
- Various bugfixes and improvements (see: [list of fixed issues for 2023.1](https://github.com/vipm-io/vipm-desktop-issues/milestone/1)) 

## What's Changed

- VIPM now uses the LabVIEW 2020 64-bit Runtime Engine (and will download+install it, if it's not already installed on your system)
- VIPM Browser was removed from this release -- users are encouraged to use vipm.io to search for packages online.
- VIPM System Tray icon/feature was removed from this release -- this feature was partially designed to reduce time to start VIPM, which has been greatly improved by upgrading VIPM to a 64-bit app.
