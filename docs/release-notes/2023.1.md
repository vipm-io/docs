# VIPM 2023.1 for Windows - Release Notes [DRAFT / BETA]

**Notice: This is a Beta Release (these notes and features are not final)**

## What's New

- Added support for LabVIEW 2023 on Windows 64-bit (not yet released).
- VIPM for Windows is now a 64-bit application (note: it still works with both 32-bit and 64-bit LabVIEW).
- More package building, package configuration management, and other features are available to all LabVIEW users.
- Various bugfixes and improvements.

## What's Changed

- VIPM Browser was removed from this release -- users are encouraged to use vipm.io to search for packages online.
- VIPM System Tray icon/feature was removed from this release -- this feature was partially designed to reduce time to start VIPM, which has been greatly improved by upgrading VIPM to a 64-bit app.
