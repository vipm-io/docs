# VIPM 2023.3 (build 2523) for Windows - Release Notes

## What's New

- VIPM now works with any LabVIEW Runtime greater than or equal to 20.1, to simplify installation process and avoid installing older versions of LabVIEW runtime if a newer version is installed (VIPM previously required exactly version 20.1 of the LV Runtime)
- Fix [#26](https://github.com/vipm-io/vipm-desktop-issues/issues/26) (and its duplicates [#23](https://github.com/vipm-io/vipm-desktop-issues/issues/23), [#24](https://github.com/vipm-io/vipm-desktop-issues/issues/24), [#25](https://github.com/vipm-io/vipm-desktop-issues/issues/25)) affecting various user input dialogs (e.g. palette item renaming caused the dialog to get stuck and not close)
- Fix [#31](https://github.com/vipm-io/vipm-desktop-issues/issues/31) fixed issue where VIPC would sometimes switch to System target instead of correct LabVIEW target and VIPC file would not be applied.
- Improved package building in LabVIEW 2017-2019 (some improvements make for packages saved in LV 2020 and greater were back-propagated to work with older LabVIEW versions)
- Speed-up of VIPM startup time for first launch after installation (installer now includes a cache of package info of latest versions of public packages)
