---

VIPM 2025Q3 Fix 1 is a fix release for Windows that fixes a build and LabVIEW target migration issue.

> Note: You will need an active VIPM Pro subscription in order to activate VIPM 2025Q3 F1 into Pro Edition.


## Fixes
- **Build Issue**: Resolved an issue where packages containing support files would fail to build correctly, ensuring that all support files are now properly handled and included during the package build process. More information.
- **Migration**: Resolved an issue where VIPM would not recognize previously installed packages after updating LabVIEW from the Q1 to Q3 release. This fix specifically addresses migration from Q1 to Q3 (reverse migration from Q3 to Q1 will be supported in a future release).
- **Quick Search**: Resolved an issue where the new search algorithm (preview feature) wouldn't respond to column sorting.
